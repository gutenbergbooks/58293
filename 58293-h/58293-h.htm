<p>Once upon a time there lived in France a
poet-bureaucrat by the name of Charles
Perrault, who wrote fairy tales. He called
one of them <i>Cendrillon ou la Petite Pantoufle
de Verre</i>, and ever since 1697, for that was
the date of Cinderella&rsquo;s appearance in modern literature,
her glass slippers have been a puzzle.</p>
<p>Not to children, of course. Generations of youngsters have
matter-of-factly accepted as the most natural thing in the
world that magic slippers should be of glass (<i>verre</i>). Their
elders, however, being less sophisticated about such things,
have learnedly quibbled over whether the slippers weren&rsquo;t
really supposed to be of <i>vair</i>, the costly white squirrel fur
once worn only by royalty.</p>
<p>After all, logic and reason and custom and tradition say
that footwear has been made of leather since time unknown.
And who ever heard of making shoes out of glass?</p>
<p>Well, who ever heard of making bottles out of leather,
for that matter? Or of fire hose made of leather? Or of
leather cannons?</p>
<p>Yet leather has been put to these and many other uses
over the centuries of recorded history. A list of them would
be almost endless, and so would a list of the sources of
leather. The following compilation, doubtless far from complete,
could have been (it was not) drawn up by an English
eighteenth-century or colonial American leatherworker:</p>

<p>Leather differs not only according to the species of creature
it comes from but according to the age and sometimes
the sex of the animal, and also the part of the animal&rsquo;s body
it once covered. Its characteristics vary depending on the
type of processing it undergoes&mdash;whether by liming, tanning,
tawing (mineral tanning), or shamoying (oil tanning)&mdash;and
depending on how these processes are varied and combined.</p>
<p>Leather can be stiff as bone or supple as silk, nearly as
waterproof as rubber or capable of sopping up water like
a sponge, tough and unyielding or resilient and stretchy,
smooth and translucent as paper, deeply grained in many
patterns, or softly napped. It may be snowwhite or range
through hues of tan and red to dark brown. It may be
molded, carved, and colored in endless array. As leatherworkers
for many centuries have been fond of reminding
the world, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like leather.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>THERE&rsquo;S NOTHING LIKE TANNING</i></span></h2>
<p>Homer&rsquo;s <i>Iliad</i> contains what may be the earliest surviving
literary reference to leathermaking. Describing the
swaying fight for possession of Patroclus&rsquo;s corpse, the author
(in Pope&rsquo;s translation) wrote:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As when the slaughter&rsquo;d bull&rsquo;s yet reeking hide,</p>
<p class="t0">Strain&rsquo;d with full force, and tugged from side to side</p>
<p class="t0">The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o&rsquo;er</p>
<p class="t0">The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore....</p>
</div>
<p>The untidy process here alluded to as currying was doubtless
one of man&rsquo;s first methods of making leather. It consisted
of laboriously working into a hide or skin such greasy
and albuminous substances as animal fats, brains, blood,
milk, and so forth. The product, although technically not
&ldquo;leather,&rdquo; had many of leather&rsquo;s characteristics; this is a
paradox that calls for some definitions. In the terminology
of the trade:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hides are the pelts of the larger animals&mdash;cattle, horses, buffalo, elephants, and so on;</p>
<p class="t0">Skins come from smaller animals&mdash;calves, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, beaver, etc.&mdash;and from birds, fish, and reptiles;</p>
<p class="t0">Leather is any hide or skin <i>after it has been tanned</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>As the legislature of colonial Virginia put it in 1691 (in an
act that will shortly engage our attention again):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And for the avoyding of all ambiguities and doubts, which may and
doe grow and arise upon the difinition and interpretation of this word
leather, <i>Be it enacted and declared</i>, that hydes and skinns of oxe, steer,
bull, cow, calfe, deer, goats and sheep being tann&rsquo;d shall be, and ever
hath been reputed and taken leather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word is &ldquo;tanned.&rdquo; Like any organic matter, skins
and hides will soon begin to decay unless they receive some
kind of preservative treatment. They may be simply scraped
and sundried&mdash;or salted or smoked or soaked in brine or
in slaked lime. From some of these processes may come
extremely tough and durable products&mdash;rawhide, parchment,
and vellum are limed&mdash;but they are not leather because
they have not been <i>tanned</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="center"><span class="large"><i>Taneur</i></span></span>
<i>This illustration from Diderot&rsquo;s great eighteenth-century French encyclopedia
shows the essential operations in a tannery: A) washing hides in a stream;
B) scraping hair or flesh from a hide on the &ldquo;beam&rdquo;; C) soaking hides in a
series of lime pits; D) bedding hides in a tanning vat with a layer of shredded
bark between each hide; E) stirring lighter hides in a hot water tanning solution.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Tanning brings about within the fibrous structure of a
pelt certain chemical and physical rearrangements that are
still imperfectly understood. Their effect, however, is to
render the pelt permanently imputrescible, pliable when
dry, and capable of sustaining repeated wetting without
hurt. The agents responsible for the transformation, known
as &ldquo;tannins,&rdquo; are found in almost all plants, in certain
minerals, and in various readily oxidizing oils.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>TANNING AND CURRYING</i></span></h2>
<p>The ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians,
central Asians, and Chinese all knew tanned leather
and used it. But who first discovered how to tan it, when
that happened, and where, must remain forever unanswered,
since the invention of tanning came before the invention
of written records. Primitive leatherworkers probably stumbled
on different processes at different times and places, and
quite possibly a number of widely separated workers discovered
the same processes independently.</p>
<p>Until the invention of chrome tanning in the second half
of the nineteenth century, little change had taken place in
the three basic tanning methods for at least two thousand
years. The most widely practiced method involved the use
of vegetable tannins. Occidental tanners employed oak bark,
gallnuts, and sumac leaves among their chief sources; other
plants rich in tannins are found in every continent.</p>
<p>Mineral tanning with alum, called &ldquo;tawing,&rdquo; has been in
use since earliest time in Babylonia, Egypt, and probably
China. Because the leather so made is snow white, workers
in this specialty gained the name of &ldquo;whitetawyers.&rdquo; Tawed
leather, although soft and stretchy, is very strong; quite
appropriately, one of his eighteenth-century contemporaries
described Richard Bland, the Williamsburg lawyer and
political pamphleteer, as &ldquo;staunch &amp; tough as whitleather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currying&mdash;whatever it may have meant to Homer (or to
Alexander Pope)&mdash;is not a method of preparing hides and
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
skins from fresh-slaughtered animals, but a complex of processes
for treating leather already tanned. These processes
include smoothing the leather, paring it down to even thickness
overall, especially working fatty matter into it for
pliancy and water resistance, and giving it whatever surface
dressing, color, and finish its intended use calls for. Prominent
among such uses in the eighteenth century were shoe
uppers, harness and saddlery, upholstery, trunkmaking, and
bookbinding.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>CHIEF LEATHER CRAFTS</i></span></h2>
<p>A list compiled in London in 1422 recorded 111 groups
or guilds of merchants and craftsmen then active in that
city. Fourteen of these concerned themselves with leather
or with articles made of it in large part:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">cofferers</p>
<p class="t0">cordwainers</p>
<p class="t0">curriers</p>
<p class="t0">girdlers</p>
<p class="t0">glovers</p>
<p class="t0">leather dyers</p>
<p class="t0">leathersellers</p>
<p class="t0">loriners (or lorimers)</p>
<p class="t0">malemakers</p>
<p class="t0">pouchmakers</p>
<p class="t0">saddlers</p>
<p class="t0">skinners</p>
<p class="t0">tanners</p>
<p class="t0">whitetawyers</p>
</div>
<p>Of these, only tanners, curriers, cordwainers, and saddlers
showed up prominently in colonial Virginia&mdash;although always
as individual craftsmen, not as members of an organized
craft or guild.</p>
<p>Cordwainers&mdash;the word comes from cordovan, a kind of
sumac-tanned leather much favored in medieval England
and made originally in the Spanish city of Cordoba&mdash;were
shoemakers. The craft is to be carefully distinguished from
that of cobbling, which is the mending of shoes. Although
practically all colonial Virginia shoemakers also did shoe
repairing, the trade of cobbling was looked on, especially by
cordwainers, as inferior in status.</p>
<p>Curiously, the initial groups of colonists sent to Jamestown
by the Virginia Company lacked any leather craftsmen.
Somehow the London &ldquo;adventurers&rdquo; thought that the
real adventurers to America could get along without tanners,
curriers, or shoemakers. Just how the colonists were expected
to acquire shoes grows even more puzzling in light
of the English law that forbade exportation of goods made
of English leather.</p>
<p>In a few years, however, some tanners and shoemakers
had been sent over and were at work in Jamestown. But not
enough of them came or else (as is more likely) they abandoned
their trades to grow tobacco. A 1625 report declared
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
that an extreme shortage of shoes and other apparel endangered
the health of the population. Soon thereafter the
Virginia Assembly took the first of many steps to promote
leathermaking and other manufactures in the colony.</p>
<p>Sometimes with the support of the home government,
sometimes without, the assembly passed laws in 1632, 1645,
1658, 1660, 1662, 1680, and 1682 forbidding the export from
Virginia of hides, skins, and certain other commodities. They
hoped in this way to assure ample supplies of the raw
materials and thus encourage colonial craftsmen to make
more of the needed products.</p>
<p>The legislation, in actuality, had less effect in Virginia
than in England. Colonial craftsmen continued to prefer
leathers imported from England, reputed to be the best of
their kinds, for quality work&mdash;and to prefer tobacco growing
to leatherworking anyway. But English merchants and
craftsmen repeatedly protested the threat of competition
in a market they felt belonged solely to them, so each
colonial law in turn was either repealed on orders from
London or simply allowed to lapse.</p>
<p>The 1662 effort, somewhat more elaborate than the others,
had no greater success in the end. At Jamestown the legislature
that year passed three laws intended to increase
local manufactures. One barred the export of hides, wool,
and iron; another exempted from taxation any craftsman
who followed his trade and did not plant tobacco; the third
required each county in the colony of Virginia to erect
&ldquo;one or more tanhouses, and ... provide tanners, curryers
and shoemakers, to tanne, curry and make the hides of the
country into leather and shoes.&rdquo; The manager of this trade
for each county was to allow the people two pounds of
tobacco for each pound of dry hide they brought to the
tannery, and &ldquo;sell them shoos at thirty pounds of tobacco
[for] plaine shoos, and thirty five pounds of tobacco for
[shoes with] wooden heels and ffrench falls of the ... largest
sizes, and twenty pounds of tobacco per pair for the smaller
shoos.&rdquo;</p>

<i>As the shoemaker needed an assortment of lasts on which to make shoes of differing
sizes and shapes, so the bootmaker needed &ldquo;boot legs&rdquo; resembling his customers&rsquo;
calves. The engraving also shows a variety of eighteenth-century boot styles, the more
formidable being heavy military boots.</i> <span class="sc">Diderot.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>BEFORE FREE ENTERPRISE</i></span></h2>
<p>The seventeenth century ended with legislation of a different
tenor. &ldquo;An act declareing the dutie of Tanners, Curriers
and Shoemakers,&rdquo; passed in 1691, regulated working
procedures and set quality standards to an extent remarkable
even at a time when detailed governmental regulation
of economic activity was normal.</p>
<p>Tanners, this law decreed, were not to leave hides too
long in the lime-pits, nor put them into the tan-vats until
they had been thoroughly cleansed of lime; curriers were
not to work &ldquo;any hyde or skin not being thoroughly dry,&rdquo;
and were not to skimp on the amount or quality or freshness
of the grease they used in currying; cordwainers or shoemakers
were to use only leather that was &ldquo;well and truly
tann&rsquo;d and curryed,&rdquo; and were to make their boots, shoes,
and slippers &ldquo;well and substantially sewed with good thread
well twisted and made, and sufficiently waxed with wax well
rosined, and the stitches hard drawn with handleathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The law further required each county to appoint searchers
to examine all hides, skins, leather, and leather goods produced
in that county. They were to stamp their seal of
approval only on items that met quality standards in the
&ldquo;true intent and meaning of this act,&rdquo; and to confiscate all
wares that were &ldquo;insufficiently tann&rsquo;d, curryed, or wrought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps even more interesting than these regulations are
the reasons given for enacting them: &ldquo;Forasmuch as divers
and sundry deceits and abuses have been hitherto committed,
and daily are committed and practiced by the
Tanners, curriers, and workers of leather in ... Virginia,
to the great injury and damage of the inhabitants ...; And
forasmuch as no leather can be so well tann&rsquo;d but it may
be marred and spoyled in the currying ...; and forasmuch
as leather well tann&rsquo;d and curryed may by the negligence,
deceit or evill workmanship of the cordwainer or shoemaker
be used deceitfully to the hurt of the occupier or wearer
thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>These phrases (and similar phrases in other laws both
colonial and English) make evident that shoddy materials
and slipshod workmanship issued from the shop of many a
craftsman of the eighteenth century. A recognition of this
will help balance the romantic tendency to see every old-time
craftsman as a humble artistic genius with impeccably
high standards of workmanship.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING A LIVING</i></span></h2>
<p>For all its great length and detail, the act of 1691 seems
not to have had much effect. Governor Edmund Andros in
1697 asserted, &ldquo;There are no manufactures setled in Virginia
Except Inconsiderable tanning and shoemaking (bad
Leather).&rdquo; And in 1705 Robert Beverley wrote of the
Virginians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have their Cloathing of all sorts from <i>England</i>, as Linnen,
Woollen, Silk, Hats, and Leather.... The very Furrs that their Hats
are made of, perhaps go first from thence; and most of their Hides lie
and rot, or are made use of, only for covering dry Goods, in a leaky
House. Indeed some few Hides with much Adoe are tann&rsquo;d, and made
into Servents Shoes; but at so careless a rate, that the Planters don&rsquo;t
care to buy them, if they can get others, and sometimes perhaps a better
manager than ordinary will vouchsafe to make a pair of Breeches of a
Deer-Skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly a half-century later, as Williamsburg&rsquo;s era of
greatest affluence began, a merchant of Louisa County,
Francis Jerdone by name, lamented that &ldquo;the Virginians
have most of their shoemakers in their own families, and
have no occasion for any but stuff [i.e., cloth] shoes from
Britain.&rdquo; He referred to members of the well-to-do planter
class, who customarily maintained on their plantations one
or more skilled workmen. Among these there was almost
sure to be included a cordwainer to make and repair the
footwear of the plantation &ldquo;family,&rdquo; a term that included
the slaves. The shoemaker might be a slave himself, or an
indentured servant, or a journeyman receiving wages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>However, Francis Jerdone could just as well have been
writing of another kind of Virginia planter, the small farmer
who built his own house and barns, made his own crude
furniture, coopered his own hogsheads, ground his own corn,
sheared his own sheep, and made the family&rsquo;s shoes while
his wife spun and wove their clothing. These small farmers,
far outnumbering the great planters, would not have ordered
cloth shoes from London, to be sure. But neither would
they have ordered very many leather ones, either from
England or from Williamsburg shoemakers.</p>
<p>Documentary records&mdash;fairly full in a few cases, fleeting
in most&mdash;name 24 men who worked in leather in Williamsburg
during the eighteenth century. The ghostly existence
of others can be discerned in references to unnamed indentured
servants, journeymen, slaves, and a few apprentices
who were leatherworkers. Among Williamsburg
slaves having some craft skills, the second greatest number
were shoemakers, the greatest number being carpenters.</p>
<p>A few of these Williamsburg leatherworkers seem to have
done fairly well at their trade. Most of the others probably
had little success and moved elsewhere or into farming;
at any rate they left no trace of a continuing career.</p>

<p>Prominent in the list of known Williamsburg leatherworkers
are the names of William Pearson, tanner and
currier, Alexander Craig, saddler and harnessmaker, and
George Wilson, boot and shoemaker. As usual in colonial
Virginia, each of these men&mdash;while primarily occupied in
his own special phase of the leather trade&mdash;did more or
less work in other phases.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>William Pearson first appears in surviving records as the
godfather of Alexander Craig&rsquo;s daughter Lucretia. At about
the same time he was Craig&rsquo;s tenant in a house adjoining
the latter&rsquo;s tanyard, and shortly thereafter he purchased
from Craig the land occupied by the tanyard. The two men
seem to have been in partnership for a while, but Pearson&mdash;under
circumstances now unknown&mdash;eventually became full
owner of the tanyard.</p>
<p>This establishment lay just to the east of the town,
its location recalled to this day in the name of Tanyard
Street. It had been founded in the early 1750s by Craig
in partnership with Christopher Ford, carpenter, and
Nicholas Sim, tanner. Craig bought out his partners in
1758, and two years later Pearson came on the scene. At
that time the tannery consisted of &ldquo;Tan Vatts ... New
and Old Bark Houses, Mill House and Fleshing House ...
and all other Houses and Buildings ... used in the Business
of Tanning and making Leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pearson died in 1777, his estate included &ldquo;four
Negro men Tanners and Curriers, two shoemakers&rdquo; and
three other slaves, indicating that the late master tanner
operated a considerable business. The tanyard continued in
the possession of Pearson&rsquo;s widow and descendants for nearly
sixty years, being operated at least part of the time by
William Plume, tanner and currier from Norfolk.</p>
<p>It is hardly a secret that the processes of tanning and
currying infuse the surrounding air with a symphony of
odors&mdash;a circumstance that helps to explain why a tannery
was generally located on the far edge of a town, and usually
on the downwind side. As if hides and skins were themselves
not fragrant enough, eighteenth-century tanners, curriers,
and leather dressers made use at various stages or for
special purposes of such delectable commodities as fish oil,
sour beer, urine, barley mash, and the fermented dung of
chickens, pigeons, and dogs.</p>
<p>Sketchily described, the procedures employed by the
tanner and currier (separate crafts in England but often
combined under one roof or in the same man in colonial
America) were as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>1) Preparing the pelt included the removal of accumulated
dirt and stable trash, removal of the hair and epidermis
from the outer or grain side (except for furs),
removal of shreds of flesh and adipose tissue from the
inner side, and plumping up of the fibers of the remaining
middle layer, or corium, to be more receptive to the tanning
solution. The tanner accomplished all this by repeated washings,
followed by a sequence of soaking in solutions of lime,
and then by draining, and scraping. The scraping process,
known as unhairing and fleshing, he did laboriously with a
blunted knife, the pelt being stretched over a wooden horse
or beam. He might repeat the liming, draining, and scraping
if necessary, and he followed it up with more rinsing and
scraping to remove most or all of the lime.</p>
<p>2) Tanning proper involved soaking the hide or skin in
a series of tanning vats, each containing a stronger solution&mdash;called
&ldquo;ooze&rdquo;&mdash;than the one before. Careful and complete
tanning, a slow process, required from several weeks
for a light skin to eighteen months for a heavy hide. During
this period the hides or skins were many times &ldquo;hauled
and set,&rdquo; that is, removed from the vat and piled beside it
to drain for a time. The same sort of processing took place in
tawing, except that alum rather than oak bark supplied the
tanning agent.</p>
<p>3) Finishing included trimming, currying, and coloring
(if called for) in whatever combination of processes was
needed for the intended use of the finished leather. Readers
with uneasy stomachs should be satisfied if some of these
processes are here left undescribed, only named, to wit:
trampling, scouring, blooming, slicking, stricking, shaving,
stuffing, dubbing, boarding, graining, bruising, staking, waxing,
blacking, sizing.</p>
<p>Altogether, William Pearson might have subjected a
hide to as many as two hundred separate steps (repetitions
included in the count) in its passage from the animal&rsquo;s back
until delivery as finished leather to a shoemaker, saddler,
bookbinder, or other leather using craftsman. The total time
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
consumed would have been anything from a few months
for a lambskin, for example, to more than two years for a
thick ox hide.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>ALEXANDER CRAIG, SADDLER AND HARNESSMAKER</i></span></h2>
<p>A craftsman who had financial resources large enough to
buy a lot in Williamsburg and build a shop on it would
seem to have been in business already at another location.
Such may have been the case when Alexander Craig, just
before midcentury, acquired a lot on the road out of Williamsburg
to Yorktown&mdash;not far from where the tanyard
would soon thereafter be established.</p>
<p>A saddler and harnessmaker, Craig was the town&rsquo;s most
successful leather craftsman, possibly its most successful
craftsman in any line. He acquired a number of properties
in and near the colonial capital city over the years from
1749 until his death in 1776. Among them were the tanyard
and two choice lots on the main street near the Capitol.
One of the latter may have become his shop location, and
the other did become his residence. His eldest daughter,
Judith, married John Minson Galt, the promising young
physician and apothecary.</p>
<p>Two of Alexander Craig&rsquo;s account books survive. They
reveal that he carried on a thriving trade, kept several
indentured servants and slaves, and employed at least three
journeymen leatherworkers&mdash;although not all of these at the
same time. He bought and sold skins and hides, did tanning
and currying for himself and for others, purveyed leather
to other craftsmen, made and sometimes mended shoes, and
sold shoes that had been made in his own shop, imported
from London, or possibly made in other colonial shops. A
wide variety of other leather goods issued from his shop,
including cushions for couches, for chairs, and even for
billiard tables, sword belts, gun buckets, leather pipes for
a fire engine, razor cases, cartridge boxes, trusses, and once
a &ldquo;strong Coller for a Bear.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>But the making and mending of horse furniture&mdash;saddles,
bridles, and harness&mdash;was Craig&rsquo;s specialty. In a colony
where everyone rode constantly, saddlery was a vital craft.
And where horses, oxen, and human beings hauled, lifted,
and carried every burden, harnessmaking was no less
important.</p>
<p>The account books show that Alexander Craig valued
his labor and sold his products at a good price. He charged
Humphrey Hill &pound;7 for &ldquo;a Harness for a Shaft Chair&rdquo; and
Thomas Atkinson &pound;5 for &ldquo;a Harness for a Single Horse.&rdquo;
He billed Colonel William Byrd III &pound;25 for harness for
six coach horses, and Colonel Benjamin Harrison &pound;16 to
make harness for &ldquo;four Charriot Horses.&rdquo; For making a
side saddle with cover and studded trappings for Robert
Hutchins, a tailor of the town of Blandford some 40 miles
away, Craig charged &pound;6, 10 shillings.</p>
<p>Some idea, albeit only an approximate one, of the purchasing
power of those sums may be gained by comparing
them with prices for house furnishings at about the same
time. Colonel Robert Carter of Nomini Hall, for instance,
bought eight mahogany dining chairs, upholstered and
trimmed with brass nails, for &pound;16 from Williamsburg
cabinetmaker Benjamin Bucktrout. Four &ldquo;Elbow Chares&rdquo;
bought at the same time cost him &pound;11. A desk and bookcase&mdash;now
called a secretary&mdash;brought &pound;16.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>THE SADDLE AND HARNESS SHOP</i></span></h2>
<p>Elkanah Deane, carriagemaker of New York, removed
his business from that city to the little metropolis of Williamsburg
shortly before the Revolution. Both in New York
and in the capital of the Virginia colony he enjoyed the
patronage of His Lordship Governor Dunmore. Deane&rsquo;s
house in Williamsburg looked out upon the same green as
did the Governor&rsquo;s Palace, along with the mansions of the
wealthy Robert Carter and the learned George Wythe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>This was heady company for &ldquo;an Hibernian Cottager,&rdquo;
as one rival coachmaker called him, and perhaps Deane
deserved the label of &ldquo;Palace Street puffer&rdquo; conferred on
him by the same fellow citizen. Be that as it may, the
carriagemaker advertised that he also made, repaired, and
sold harness, although the actual work was probably done
by another craftsman in his shop.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was Edward Roberts, who gave notice in
1775 that he &ldquo;continues to carry on the business of Saddling,
Cap and Harness making, at the late Mr. Elkanah Deane&rsquo;s
shop.&rdquo; The shop, it is to be presumed, was primarily devoted
to the varied specialties that were needed in the manufacture
of wheeled vehicles, of which blacksmithing was one of the
more vital. Deane&rsquo;s forge, to the rear of his property, is a
favorite attraction in restored Williamsburg, especially for
children.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Adjoining the forge, the saddlery and harnessmaking shop
of two hundred years ago has again resumed operation.
There the visitor may see examples of saddle and harness
work done in the eighteenth-century manner with tools and
equipment resembling those shown in the great eighteenth-century
illustrated encyclopedia of Denis Diderot.</p>
<p>The basic operations in the making of harness were only
two: cutting the hides into appropriate strips and shapes,
and stitching the pieces together as needed. Simple as it
sounds, skillful choice of the leathers, flawless cutting, and
thorough stitching made the difference between good harness
and poor. Finish and ornamentation, although not essential
to the task of attaching a draft animal securely to its load,
made the product distinctive and handsome, and no doubt
gave the craftsman more pleasure in the making.</p>
<p>The harnessmaker&rsquo;s knife had a semicircular or half-moon
shape to its blade, with the handle sometimes at right
angles to the back of the blade and sometimes with a right-angled
tang that put the handle parallel to the back of the
blade. For sewing he possessed an assortment of punches
and awls and a very important holding device called a
&ldquo;clam.&rdquo; This last was a hinged wooden clamp with jaws
somewhat resembling the shell of a clam. Holding it between
his crossed thighs, the harnessmaker used it to hold fast
the straps he was sewing, thus freeing both of his hands
for the tough job of stitching through heavy leather.</p>
<p>In most essentials, and indeed in most details, the harness
of the eighteenth century looked like and functioned like
that of today&mdash;or of the not-so-distant yesterday before the
motorization of everything on wheels. Saddles, at least some
of them, were slightly different in shape and detail from
the present-day English riding saddle. For their making, as
well as for the making of collars, the saddler-harnessmaker
needed a variety of tools to pack and shape the stuffing
of pads. By and large, however, the result would seem to
have been less comfortable to both horse and rider than the
modern saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>GEORGE WILSON, BOOT AND SHOEMAKER</i></span></h2>
<p>George Wilson came originally from Norfolk, where his
older brother&mdash;or perhaps it was his uncle&mdash;John Wilson,
did boot and shoemaking on a large scale. In May 1771
the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of Williamsburg carried this advertisement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I TAKE this Method to acquaint the Publick, and my Customers in particular,
that Mess. <i>James Campbell</i> and Company have resigned the
SHOE FACTORY in Favour of me, by which Means I carry on double
the Trade I did formerly. Gentlemen who may please to favour me with
their Orders for Negro Shoes, or others, are desired to send them soon,
that I may be capable of supplying them better than it was in my Power
last Fall, on Account of the Scarcity of Leather. Ladies and Gentlemen
may depend on being supplied with as neat Shoes, either Leather or
Calimanco, as any from <i>London</i>; as I have on Hand <i>London</i>, <i>Philadelphia</i>,
and <i>New York</i> Calf Skins, red, green, and blue <i>Morocco</i> Leather,
Calimancoes of all Colours, and of the best Kinds. Those who choose to
favour him with their Custom shall be served on reasonable Terms, by
applying to him at the Sign of the <i>Boot</i> and <i>Shoe</i> in <i>Norfolk</i>.
<span class="lr">JOHN WILSON</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just five months later, announcing his death, the <i>Gazette</i>
described John Wilson as a tradesman of &ldquo;Credit and
Reputation in Norfork, whose Industry, Integrity, and
whole Deportment, were truly exemplary.&rdquo; Shortly thereafter
the same paper carried the notice that Wilson&rsquo;s estate
would be auctioned and that &ldquo;The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Business,
in all its Branches, is carried on by George Wilson, Junior,
and Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Company&rdquo; here seems to have been John&rsquo;s widow,
for the next advertisement to appear in the <i>Gazette</i> disclosed
that her partnership with George Wilson having been dissolved,
Mary Wilson &ldquo;still carries on the Shoemaking Business,
in all its Branches.&rdquo; She was one of innumerable
colonial widows whom fate threw into the awkward position
of being master craftsmen, at least until they found another
man to take over the shop&mdash;and very often the household,
too.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>George Wilson promptly turned up in Williamsburg, announcing
to the public that he had just imported a &ldquo;choice
Cargo of the best sorts of English LEATHER for all Manner
of Mens Shoes and Pumps, and excellent LONDON DRAW-LEGS
for BOOTS.&rdquo; Underscoring the ambitious size
of the business he hoped to establish, he again signed himself
&ldquo;George Wilson &amp; Co.,&rdquo; and appended a notice that
&ldquo;Two or three JOURNEYMEN SHOEMAKERS, who
understand making BOOTS and Mens WOOD HEELS,
will meet with good encouragement by applying immediately
to me, next Door to Mr. Greenhow&rsquo;s Store in <i>Williamsburg</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like other colonial shoemakers, George Wilson not only
made shoes but also repaired them. Put another way, they
all did both <i>cordwaining</i> and <i>cobbling</i>. But George Wilson
seems not to have catered to the ladies; his advertisements
mention only footwear for gentlemen, and when his shop
was broken into in March 1774 the thief took away nineteen
or twenty pairs of men&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>Whether his earlier ad failed to bring him the desired
journeymen or whether he needed still more help cannot
be said, but he advertised again that &ldquo;Two or three journeymen
shoemakers will have a good set of summer work, by
applying early, at the rate of 3s. 6d. for plain shoes, 5s. for
stitched work, and 10s. for boots.&rdquo; Before the end of the
year George Wilson, too, had died.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>LESSER LEATHER CRAFTS</i></span></h2>
<p>Among the many crafts that produced articles partly or
largely of leather, those of glover, breechesmaker, cabinetmaker,
upholsterer, coachmaker, and bookbinder were
known in eighteenth-century Williamsburg.</p>
<p>Two centuries ago William Keith, a Williamsburg tailor,
&ldquo;having lately purchas&rsquo;d an ingenious Workman in Leather
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
does hereby give Notice to all Gentlemen, and others, That
they may be supplied with Buck-skin Breeches, and Gloves,
made after the neatest Fashion, and as Cheap as anywhere
else.&rdquo; At about the same time the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> carried
this announcement of a newcomer to the colony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EDWARD MORRIS, Breeches-Maker, and Glover, from <i>London</i>,
IS set up in Business, near the College in <i>Williamsburg</i>, where he makes
and sells the best Buck Skin Breeches, either of the common Tann&rsquo;d
Colour, or dy&rsquo;d Black, or of Cloth Colours, after the <i>English</i> Manner:
Also Buck Skin Gloves, with high Tops. He also makes and sell Bever-Skin
Breeches, which are very strong and servicable, fit for Servants or
Slaves, and are very cheap. He also dresses Leather after the <i>Philadelphia</i>
manner, not inferior to Oil&rsquo;d Leather Dress, for Goodness and
Fineness, upon the Flesh or Grain. Likewise dresses all Sorts of Fur-Skins,
for Muffs, for Gentlemen or Ladies, or for Saddle-Housings.
Also dresses Calf-Skins, Sheep-Skins, and White Leather, fit for the use
of Sadlers, Shoemakers, and Others. Any Persons that have Occasion to
make Use of him in any of the Above Particulars, may depend on kind
Usage, and at very reasonable Rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as Morris did not advertise again in the <i>Gazette</i>
(so far as surviving copies show) it may be presumed that
so few persons found occasion to call on him that he moved
elsewhere or found some other way to make a living. Several
bookbinders lived and worked in eighteenth-century Williamsburg;
their craft is described in another pamphlet in
this series and is represented today in an operating craft
shop on Duke of Gloucester Street in the historic town.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>THE SHOEMAKER&rsquo;S SHOP</i></span></h2>
<p>Visitors to restored Williamsburg can identify another
operating craft shop by the overhead sign of the &ldquo;Boot &amp;
Shoemaker.&rdquo; The little building not far from the foot of
Palace Green represents the shop of George Wilson &amp; Co.
&ldquo;next Door to Mr. Greenhow&rsquo;s Store,&rdquo; and stands on foundations
of an eighteenth-century structure. In the absence
of documentary or archaeological evidence as to the appearance
of George Wilson&rsquo;s shop or its contents, the architecture
and furnishings of the shop follow traditional precedents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>

<i>An illustration, again from Diderot&rsquo;s encyclopedia, showing some European styles
and techniques of shoemaking. Colonial American styles and methods were similar.
Unfortunately no one on this side of the ocean wrote or illustrated any descriptive
books on the subject, so we must rely heavily on the French source.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>A working shop that demonstrates shoemaking and the
general skills of leatherworking, the shop&rsquo;s size and contents
are typical and authentic. One sees in it numerous
boots and shoes in various stages of construction, a full set
of lasts, other articles of leather, including belts, mugs, and
black jacks, and an assortment of knives, awls, and other
leatherworking tools of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>In contrast to this small shop in Williamsburg, the &ldquo;Shoe
Factory&rdquo; operated by John Wilson, George&rsquo;s predecessor
in Norfolk, included these items presumably found there
by the appraisers of his estate:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="r">304 </td><td class="l">pairs of &ldquo;Negroe Shoes&rdquo; valued at 5 shillings per pair</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">103 </td><td class="l">pairs of men&rsquo;s shoes, some at 6/ and some at 9/ per pair</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">6 </td><td class="l">pairs of boots at 20/ per pair, and four pairs of boot legs</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">15 </td><td class="l">pairs of women&rsquo;s shoes at 5/ and 6/; one of silk at 10/</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">79 </td><td class="l">pairs of children&rsquo;s shoes at 3/ and 3/9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">235 </td><td class="l">lasts; 60 or more hides and skins; 6&frac12; dozen heels; 3 dozen blacking balls; 17 shoemaker&rsquo;s seats; &ldquo;4 Gross Tax&rdquo;; and &ldquo;a sise stick.&rdquo;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The &ldquo;tax&rdquo; in this case is easy to evade by changing it to
tacks. The &ldquo;sise stick&rdquo; was almost certainly the same sort
of device that is used in shoe stores today to measure the
size of the customer&rsquo;s foot. But what really strikes one about
this inventory is the magnitude of the operation it reveals.
With an indicated seventeen workers, it was doubtless one of
the few mass-production factories colonial Virginia could boast.</p>
<p>The ratio of boots to shoes for men&mdash;6 to 103 pairs&mdash;seems
out of line for Virginia where, as one observer wrote,
&ldquo;even the most indigent person has his saddle-horse, which
he rides to every place, and on every occasion.&rdquo; Virginians
being &ldquo;excessively fond of horses,&rdquo; one would expect them
to have worn boots most of the time, and this expectation
would seem to be corroborated by Robert Gilbert&rsquo;s repeated
advertisements for the services of a journeyman bootmaker.
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
The evidence indicates that in the latter part of the century
boots appear to have sold better than shoes.</p>
<p>Boots (sometimes listed as &ldquo;ffrench falls&rdquo;) as well as shoes
for men, women, and children were imported from England&mdash;and
from New England&mdash;as well as being made in
the colony. Among the London makers, Didsbury &amp; Co.
enjoyed first preference for orders sent from Virginia and
paid for with shipments of tobacco. The wives and daughters
of planters, in particular, preferred to wait six months or
a year for the arrival of fashionable shoes from London
rather than buy what the local shoemaker offered, or they
sometimes patronized the milliner for &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; shoes.</p>
<p>A good shoemaker could average two pairs of shoes, welted,
turned, or stitched in a twelve-hour working day. In any
shoe the sole would be heaviest cow or ox hide, cut from
that part of the hide over the animal&rsquo;s hind quarters called
the &ldquo;bend.&rdquo; Uppers would usually be of calfskin, sometimes
of goat, sheep, or dogskin. Women&rsquo;s shoes with leather
soles very often had uppers of fabric, such as calimanco,
ticking, silk, damask, satin, or poplin.</p>
<p>Black was the color of men&rsquo;s shoes, although an occasional
example might be in color, especially the heels. For women&rsquo;s
leather shoes, red, white, blue, green, or purple prevailed.
Children&rsquo;s footwear was made in bright colors or black. Lacing,
apparently the usual fastening method in the seventeenth
century, gradually gave way in the eighteenth to straps and
buckles, the latter tending to become larger and fancier as
time passed. Buckles of brass and steel served for everyday
wear, silver and paste for dress-up occasions. The Geddy
family in Williamsburg made copper alloy buckles as good as
could be had from London, while silversmith John Coke
made them in gold. Ties, however, did not lose out completely.</p>
<p>Pointed toes held first place in fashion for both men&rsquo;s and
women&rsquo;s shoes. Again, this does not mean that round- or
square-toed shoes were not made; on the contrary, they
were not uncommon on the feet of those persons who put
other considerations before style. But style was a potent
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
governor for the well-to-do among colonial Virginians, who {...}</p>
<p>Both men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s shoes, as well as children&rsquo;s and
slaves&rsquo; shoes&mdash;, were made on straight lasts. That is, shape
and construction were the same for left and right shoe, and
either one of a pair could be worn on either foot. This situation
resulted not from some primitive crudeness or ineptitude
on the part of colonial cordwainers, who could and if
called upon did make paired left-and-right shoes. Rather, it
embodied an aesthetic preference. Symmetrical shoes pleased
the eighteenth-century eye more in themselves and left a
more pleasing pattern of tracks than did unsymmetrical
shoes.</p>
<p>If that seems a curious judgment, just remember that
your own preference for paired shoes would strike your
style-conscious colonial forebears as quite unthinkable.</p>

<p>The list below includes the known leatherworkers who
engaged in business in Williamsburg during the eighteenth
century. The dates following the men&rsquo;s names indicate the
years the men are known to have worked in the city.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Thomas Allen&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1710-1716</i>). The first record
of Thomas Allen is in 1710 when the death of his daughter
was recorded in the Bruton Parish register. In 1716 Allen
purchased a lot in Williamsburg. No other information concerning
Allen has been located.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>John Coulthard&mdash;saddler</i> (<i>1734-1756</i>). John Coulthard&rsquo;s
name is first mentioned in Williamsburg in 1734 when he
did saddlery work for Thomas Jones. In 1751 he announced
in the Virginia Gazette that he had moved his shop &ldquo;from
next Door to the Printing-Office to the back Street, next
Door to the house of Mr. Walter King.&rdquo; Coulthard died
in 1756.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Alexander Craig&mdash;saddler</i> (<i>1748-1776</i>). Alexander Craig,
who owned a saddle shop and tannery, is first mentioned
in Williamsburg in 1748. His business was quite extensive.
Craig made and sold shoes, saddles, harness, and other
leather goods, and he employed several journeymen leatherworkers.
Craig died in 1776 and left a large estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p class="tb"><i>Robert Gilbert&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1768-1783</i>). Robert Gilbert
announced in 1768 that he had &ldquo;opened Shop near the Capitol
in Williamsburg,&rdquo; where he advertised leather and shoes for
sale. Gilbert continued his business in Williamsburg until
1783 when he moved to Richmond.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Henry Gill&mdash;tanner and shoemaker</i> (<i>1707-1720</i>). Henry
Gill, tanner and shoemaker, arrived in Williamsburg from
Charles City County in 1707. He established his shop on
Duke of Gloucester Street, where he soon opened an ordinary.
Gill died in 1720.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Daniel Groome&mdash;tanner and collarmaker</i> (<i>1713-1719</i>).
Daniel Groome purchased a lot in Williamsburg in 1713.
At that time he was described as being from James City
County. By 1719 Groome had left Williamsburg and settled
in Henrico County.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>James Hern&mdash;harnessmaker</i> (<i>1762-1764</i>). James Hern
worked as a journeyman harnessmaker with Alexander
Craig from 1762 to about 1764.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Gabriel Maupin&mdash;saddler and harnessmaker</i> (<i>1752-ca1800</i>).
Gabriel Maupin was born in Williamsburg and probably
learned his trade from Alexander Craig. He carried on the
saddle and harnessmaking business, but was primarily a
tavern-keeper. He died about 1800.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Edward Morris&mdash;leather-breeches maker and glover</i> (<i>1739</i>).
Little is known of Edward Morris. He announced the
opening of his business &ldquo;near the College in Williamsburg&rdquo; in
June 1739. In his advertisement he stated that he was from
London. In addition to making breeches and gloves, he
dressed leather &ldquo;after the Philadelphia manner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p class="tb"><i>William Pearson&mdash;tanner</i> (<i>1760-1777</i>). William Pearson
appeared in Williamsburg in 1760. He worked with Alexander
Craig and may have been in partnership with him.
Pearson later became owner of Craig&rsquo;s tannery in Williamsburg,
which he operated until his death in 1777.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>William Plume&mdash;tanner</i> (<i>1777-1783</i>). William Plume came
to Williamsburg from Norfolk in 1777 and leased Pearson&rsquo;s
tannery. He operated the tanyard until 1783 when he returned

<p class="tb"><i>William Quirk&mdash;leatherdresser</i> (<i>1745</i>). William Quirk was
either an indentured servant or journeyman who worked
with Robert Simpson, leather-breeches maker of Williamsburg.
In 1745 Simpson advertised that Quirk had &ldquo;absconded
from his Habitation&rdquo; in Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Edward Roberts&mdash;saddler and harnessmaker</i> (1775-1777).
Edward Roberts evidently established his business in Williamsburg
before 1775. In that year he advertised that he
&ldquo;continues to carry on the business of Saddling, Cap and
Harness making, at the late Mr. Elkanah Deane&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;
He left Williamsburg in 1777 to settle in Maryland.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>John Rolleson&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1750-1784</i>). Very little is
known of John Rolleson. He is mentioned as being in
Williamsburg in 1750, and he purchased leather from
Alexander Craig during the 1760s. Rolleson&rsquo;s estate was
settled in York County Court in 1784.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>John Sclater&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1774</i>). John Sclater is mentioned
as being of both Williamsburg and York County
in 1774, when Matthew Evans was apprenticed to him.
Sclater offered &ldquo;good Encouragement&rdquo; for &ldquo;a Sober Journeyman
Shoemaker who understands Mens and Womens work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="tb"><i>John Shepherd&mdash;harnessmaker</i> (<i>1761-1787</i>). John Shepherd
worked as a journeyman harnessmaker with Alexander
Craig from 1761 to 1762. About 1772 he apparently established
his own business and advertised himself as &ldquo;Coach,
Chaise, and Harness Maker from London.&rdquo; Shepherd died
in Williamsburg sometime in 1787.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Nicholas Sim&mdash;tanner</i> (<i>1758</i>). Nicholas Sim was a partner
with Alexander Craig in a tannery in Williamsburg. When
Craig bought out his partners in 1758, Sim left Williamsburg
to settle in Petersburg.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Robert Simpson&mdash;leather-breeches maker</i> (<i>1745</i>). Robert
Simpson of Williamsburg advertised for a runaway indentured
servant or journeyman in 1745.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Thomas Skinner&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1765-1777</i>). Thomas Skinner
came to Williamsburg from Henrico County sometime
before 1765. He engaged in the shoemaking business until
1777 when he dropped from sight.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>James Swain&mdash;leather-breeches maker</i> (<i>1763</i>). Little is
known of James Swain. He is mentioned in Alexander
Craig&rsquo;s account book in 1763. In that year Swain made a
shot bag for Craig. He may have been the same James
Swain who is mentioned in Henrico County in 1777.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>James Taylor&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1742-1775</i>). James Taylor is
first mentioned in 1742. He may have been in business with
William Wilcox, shoemaker. In 1751 Wilcox and Taylor
advertised for two runaway indentured shoemakers. Taylor
engaged in business in Williamsburg until 1775 when he
dropped from sight.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>George Wells&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1738-1753</i>). George Wells came
to Virginia in 1738 at the age of 21 as an indentured
servant. He was engaged to work for seven years. In 1751
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
he advertised lodgings for rent in Williamsburg, where he
worked at the trade of a shoemaker. He died in 1753 and
left a fairly large estate.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>William Wilcox&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1748-1757</i>). William Wilcox
is first mentioned in 1748. He may have been in business
with James Taylor by 1751. Wilcox died in 1757 and left
a large estate.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>George Wilson&mdash;shoemaker</i> (<i>1773-1774</i>). George Wilson
was probably a brother of John Wilson, shoemaker of
Norfolk. After John Wilson&rsquo;s death in 1771, George carried
on his shoemaking business in Norfolk until he moved to

business in Williamsburg until his own death in
1774.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
